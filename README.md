# Theatomheart's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (THEAARBS)

## Installation:

On an Arch-based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO theatomheart.net/theaarbs.sh
sh theaarbs.sh
```

That's it.

## What is LARBS?

THEARBS will automatically setup my **[Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)** configuration.

Thanks to [Luke Smith](http://lukesmith.xyz) and [his YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/LukeSmithxyz) for demonstrating why I should use [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org).

THEAARBS is ~~directly lifted~~ forked from Luke's [LARBS](http://larbs.xyz) script.
